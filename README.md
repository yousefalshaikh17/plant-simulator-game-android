# Plant Simulator Game for Android
### Overview

The Plant Simulator game was created as an Android project using Kotlin, aimed at testing and expanding my Android development skills. It utilizes on-board accelerometers and follows Object-Oriented principles along with several Design Patterns to provide a clean and efficient architecture. The gameplay challenges the player to manage three plants by watering them appropriately, ensuring they do not dry out or drown. The game also features performance-based comments, offering feedback based on how well the player is managing the plants.

### Development & Features

This game was developed for Android using Kotlin. Key milestones included:

- Applied best practices for mobile development on Android.
- Integrated the accelerometer to enhance user interaction by detecting motion.
- Followed Object-Oriented principles and used multiple Design Patterns to maintain a clean, scalable codebase.

### Real-World Applications

While this project may appear to purely involve game development, it also heavily involved using Android Studio to create and link scenes and UI elements. This project allowed me to demonstrate skills in mobile development with attention to user interaction and motion detection. It also served as an opportunity to integrate accelerometer functionality and optimize gameplay for a more immersive experience.

### Challenges & Learnings

This project had multiple challenges. The biggest challenge was implementing the game while making sure that it ran at stable framerates. This was solved through the use of dynamic programming techniques. Other challenges included trouble with tuning the accelerometer support, which was resolved through implementation of weights and minimum & maximum values from the sensor.

### Other Platforms
The game was later ported to iOS, taking advantage of their SpriteKit framework. Repository for this game can be found [here](https://github.com/yousefalshaikh17/plant-simulator-game-ios).
