# Plant Simulator Game for Android/iOS
### Overview

The Plant Simulator game was created as an Android project using Kotlin, aimed at testing and expanding my Android development skills. The game was later ported to iOS, incorporating platform-specific features to enhance the user experience. It utilizes on-board accelerometers and follows Object-Oriented principles along with several Design Patterns to provide a clean and efficient architecture. The gameplay challenges the player to manage three plants by watering them appropriately, ensuring they do not dry out or drown. The game also features performance-based comments, offering feedback based on how well the player is managing the plants.

### Development & Features

This game was developed for Android using Kotlin and Swift for iOS. Key milestones included:

- Applied best practices for both mobile development platforms.
- Made use of iOS feature set including use of gestures to control gameplay, such as adjusting the amount of water poured.
- Integrated the accelerometer to enhance user interaction by detecting motion.
- Followed Object-Oriented principles and used multiple Design Patterns to maintain a clean, scalable codebase.

### Real-World Applications

While this project may appear to purely involve game development, it also heavily involved using Android Studio and Xcode to create and link scenes and UI elements. This project allowed me to demonstrate skills in cross-platform development, with particular attention to platform-specific user interactions like gestures on iOS. It also served as an opportunity to integrate accelerometer functionality and optimize gameplay for a more immersive experience.

### Challenges & Learnings

This project had multiple challenges. The biggest challenge was implementing the game while making sure that it ran at stable framerates. This was solved through the use of dynamic programming techniques. Other challenges included trouble with tuning the accelerometer support, which was resolved through implementation of weights and minimum & maximum values from the sensor.
